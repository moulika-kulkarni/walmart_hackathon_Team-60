The proposed idea aims to develop a credit card fraud detection machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm. The model's primary goal is to detect and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions 
in real-time, providing robust security measures to financial institutions and their customers.
The credit card fraud detection model will be trained on a diverse and comprehensive dataset that includes both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. This model shows the implementation of both Isolation Forest 
as well as Random Forest algorithm. Random Forest algorithm works better with unbalanced datasets. Leveraging the Random Forest algorithm, the model will create an ensemble of decision trees, each independently 
analyzing subsets of the data, and combine their outputs to make a final prediction.To ensure optimal performance, the dataset will undergo preprocessing steps to handle missing values, normalize features, and 
address class imbalance. 
The proposed model's alignment with credit card fraud detection lies in its ability to handle complex and non-linear relationships in the data, making it adept at capturing intricate patterns indicative of 
fraudulent activities. Moreover, the Random Forest's capability to identify the most important features contributing to the predictions allows for better interpretability and understanding of the fraud 
detection process.
In conclusion, the proposed credit card fraud detection machine learning model based on the Random Forest algorithm presents a promising solution to combat credit card fraud in real-time, leveraging ensemble 
learning to achieve accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, ultimately bolstering the security of financial systems.
